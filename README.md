## Prerequisites

No hardware prerequisites and no instalation needed. This aplication works 100% online and can be accessed in any device (100% responsive!).

## How to navigate

As a good ecommerce, pro-geek's home page already provides some great action figures sugestions and you can either access more details about any product by clicking on it's cart or directly adding any quantity to cart if you are already intending to buy it. You can also use the search bar or click in any category placed in the navigation bar to filter your search and find the products you want.
All products added in your cart can be revised by clicking on the shopping cart icon located in the upper-right side of the site. There you can review your purchase by adding, subtracting or even removing a product from your cart before proceed to checkout (of course you need to have a account and be logged in our site to conclude your purchase ;-]).
Once logged-in, you will be able to manage your account information and follow up your purchases.

ADMIN Access:
If you login with an ADMIN account, you will have some additiona access priviledges in your profile page. An ADMIN is able to manage all orders to keep customers updated and can create/manage all products and categories available in the ecommerce. This makes the aplication fully functional since you can create new products, add new categories and easily access and manage all orders received. 

## Additional implementations and improvements

Althouth the app is fully functional, improvements can be made to increase user's experience:

* Add a rating grade to each restaurant and show search results by the highest to lowest grade.
